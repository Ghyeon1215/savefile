                        (The scenery is very beautiful with artificial facilities such as Lotte Tower and Lotte World combined with the natural environment like the Han River.)<p>
                        </p>My hometown is Jamsil, Seoul, Korea. Seoul is the capital and largest city of Korea, and Jamsil, where I grew up, is one of the well-known areas of Seoul. Jamsil is famous for Lotte World, an amusement park. It has many amusement facilities that rejuvenate people who are tired of hard work.<p>
                        </p>People from other parts of Korea and abroad visit Lotte World a lot. So Jamsil has more foreigners than other areas. I'm proud to have such a famous facility in my hometown.<p>
                        </p>Three years ago, Lotte Tower, the tallest building in Korea, was built. Not only is the Lotte Tower high, but the interior is also very luxurious. Thanks to this building, real estate prices in Jamsil, where we live, have risen a lot.<p>
                        </p>Besides, there are many famous restaurants and amenities in Jamsil. I have lived in Jamsil for more than 10 years, so I know them in detail.
